# VisualStudio Gtk# Forms Template
 A Visual Studio C# Gtk Forms Template.
 Allthought you can't use a Visual Designer to draw your Form, you still can write it down and simple run the GUI.
 I wrote it for my self for Cross Development and in case that the Windows VS IDE still works smoothesd.

### Requirements
 Needs MonoDevelope for Windows and the Visual Studio Integration to be installed. Either download the All in One pkg from their site:

 ..or get the [source from their github](https://github.com/mono/mono "Mono") and compiled it your self.
 
 
### Installing
 Simple Copy the [zip](https://github.com/cfwprpht/VisualStudio-Gtk-Forms-Template/releases "download template") file from the download section into your personal template folder.
 My base Folder is on the c disk with the Directory 'Coding', so my base folder path is as follow
 'C:\Coding\Templates\ProjectTemplates'

 After that it will pop up in the C# Templates List for creating a new Project.
